Exploring challenges and opportunities for deeply decarbonizing the Colombian Economy. Part of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project in Latin America (DDPP-LAC)

## Abstract
The Paris agreement called on parties to formulate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances. Mid-century strategies are both necessary for effective planning and officially called for in the Paris Agreement. This paper aims to contribute with the definition of Colombia’s mid-century strategy. In this study, we use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to develop three representative pathways toward deep decarbonization by mid-century. We explore what might happen under Colombia’s current policy trajectory, in the context of 30\% and 90\% reductions in CO$_2$ emissions by mid-century. The scenarios here are intended to provide insights into strategic issues at the heart of long-term planning, such as the overall scale of the challenge, actions that might lead to technological lock-in, and feasible strategies in different sectors. In this study, we explore technological decarbonization pathways that are consistent with the broader Colombian goals of economic growth and poverty alleviation. In Colombia, reaching the Paris goals might imply structural changes in the energy and AFOLU sectors, including the adoption of emerging technologies such as sustainable bio-based fuels and Carbon Capture and Storage.
